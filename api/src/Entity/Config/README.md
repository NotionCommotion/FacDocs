Purpose is to allow some settings common for all organizations and/or users and the ability to override.
Currently only implemented for tenant organization and Tenant has the overrideOrganization propoerty.
Need to figure out how to expose within entity.
Maybe get rid of.

Settings to add:
    Maximum File Size for uploads
    NOT allowed file types as it will be handled differently.
